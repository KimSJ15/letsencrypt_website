## Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) {#ACME}

ACME is the protocol implemented by [Let's Encrypt](#LE). Softwares compatibles with that protocol can use it to communicate with Let's Encrypt to asks for a [certificate](#leaf).

## Canonical Name record (CNAME) {#CNAME}

A Canonical Name record is a DNS entry which maps one domain name to another, referred to as the Canonical Name.

## Certificate Authority (CA) {#CA}

A certificate authority is an organisation that issues [certificate](#leaf).
[Let's Encrypt](#LE) and [IdenTrust](#IdenTrust) are Certificate Authorities.

## Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) {#CAA}

CAA is a DNS record that allows to specify which (CA)[#CA] are allowed to issue certificate for the corresponding domain.
[Let's Encrypt](#LE) does check and respects CAA records.

## Delegation Name record (DNAME) {#DNAME}

A DNAME record creates an alias for an entire subtree of the domain name tree. In contrast, the [CNAME](#CNAME) record creates an alias for a single name and not its subdomains.

## Revocation

A certificate is valid until it's expiration date, expect if the [CA](#CA) says it's been revoked.
The certificate may be revoked for various reasons such as the compromission of the private key.

Browsers can check if a certificate is revoked using [CRL](#CLR) or [OCSP](#OCSP).
Let's Encrypt only supports the [OCSP](#OCSP) method.

[Let's Encrypt](#LE) allows the users to asks for the revocation if you

- Can prove you control the domain of the certificate
- Can prove you control the account that generated the certificate
- Can prove you have the private key of the certificate

## Wildcard Certificates {#wildcard}

Wildcard certificates are valid for any subdomains (but for only one level): a certificate for `*.example.com` is valid for `anything.example.com` (but **not** for `something.anything.com` nor `example.com`)

[Let's Encrypt](#LE) does provide Wildcards certificates.

## internationalized domain name (IDN) {#IDN}

IDN domains are domains with caracters others than `a` to `z`, `0` to `9` and `-`. They can for example contains Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hebrew or the Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics or ligatures. The encoded representation of an IDN domains starts with `xn--`.

IDN is supported by [Let's Encrypt](#LE).
